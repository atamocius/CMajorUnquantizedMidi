# CMajorUnquantizedMidi

A CMajor patch demo showing that notes generated by using a _wait_ `loop` does not seem to produce well timed `NoteOff`s even though `Tempo.framesPerQuarterNote()` produces consistent results.

> ## Note
>
> As of version `1.0.2520` of CMajor, this behavior does not manifest when using `ASIO` or `WASAPI` audio drivers. However, when using other drivers, such as `WaveOut`, stuttering occurs when sending out MIDI events.
